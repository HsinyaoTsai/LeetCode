# Leetcode 617
## 题面
Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other,
 some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. 
The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
## 题意
归并两棵树

*二叉树可能是我最爱的数据结构了，我又高潮了哦也*
## 思路
### 解法
从无到有。
### 代码
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        return helper(t1, t2);
    }
    
    private TreeNode helper(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1==null && t2==null) return null;
        if(t1!=null && t2!=null) {
            t1.val += t2.val;
            t1.left = helper(t1.left, t2.left);
            t1.right = helper(t1.right, t2.right);
            return t1;
        }
        if(t1==null) return t2;
        return t1;
    }
}
```
